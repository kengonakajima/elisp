;; Netscape elements and attributes
;; An html-helper-mode module

;; Joe Hildebrand <hildjj@fuentez.com> - 23 May 1995
;; version: 1.2

;; This code is distributed under the same terms as html-helper-mode
;; itself.  html-helper-mode for Emacs is written and maintained by
;; Nelson Minar <nelson@santafe.edu>, and is available from
;; <URL:http://www.santafe.edu/~nelson/tools/>.  Nelson takes no
;; responsibility for what I have done with his software!

;; The extensions to HTML supported by this module are documented at
;; <URL:http://home.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/html_extensions.html>.

;; This code must be called *after* html-helper-mode loads.  It can be
;; run nicely from the html-helper-load-hook.
