;;; Commentary:

;; Purpose of this program is emulating for who does not have "custom".
;; (custom.el bundled with v19 is old; does not have following macros.)
;;
;; DEFCUSTOM below has the same effect as the original DEFVAR has.
;; DEFFACE below interprets almost of all arguments.
;; DEFGROUP and DEFINE-WIDGET below are just nop macro.

;;; Code:

(require 'poe)

(defmacro-maybe defgroup (symbol members doc &rest args)
  "Declare SYMBOL as a customization group containing MEMBERS.
SYMBOL does not need to be quoted.
Third arg DOC is the group documentation.

This is a nop defgroup only for emulating purpose."
  nil)

(defmacro-maybe defcustom (symbol value doc &rest args)
  "Declare SYMBOL as a customizable variable that defaults to VALUE.
DOC is the variable documentation.

This is a defcustom only for emulating purpose.
Its effect is just as same as that of defvar."
  (` (defvar (, symbol) (, value) (, doc))))

(defvar-maybe frame-background-mode nil
  "*The brightness of the background.
Set this to the symbol dark if your background color is dark, light if
your background is light, or nil (default) if you want Emacs to
examine the brightness for you.  However, the old Emacsen might not
examine the brightness, so you should set this value definitely.")

(defmacro-maybe-cond defface (face spec doc &rest args)
  "Declare FACE as a customizable face that defaults to SPEC.
FACE does not need to be quoted.

Third argument DOC is the face documentation, it is ignored.

It does nothing if FACE has been bound, otherwise set the face
attributes according to SPEC.

The remaining arguments should have the form

   [KEYWORD VALUE]...

The following KEYWORDs are defined:

:group  VALUE should be a customization group, but it is ignored.

SPEC should be an alist of the form ((DISPLAY ATTS)...).

ATTS is of the form (KEY VALUE) where KEY is a symbol of `:foreground',
`:background', `:bold', `:italic' or `:underline'.  The other KEYs are
ignored.

The ATTS of the first entry in SPEC where the DISPLAY matches the
frame should take effect in that frame.  DISPLAY can either be the
symbol t, which will match all frames, or an alist of the form
\((REQ ITEM...)...)

For the DISPLAY to match a FRAME, the REQ property of the frame must
match one of the ITEM.  The following REQ are defined:

`type' (the value of `window-system')
  Should be one of `x' or `tty'.

`class' (the frame's color support)
  Should be one of `color', `grayscale', or `mono'.

`background' (the value of `frame-background-mode', what color is used
for the background text)
  Should be one of `light' or `dark'."
